sudo crontab -e

Examples
Here is a list of examples for some common schedules you might encounter while configuring cron.

To run a command every minute:

* * * * *
To run a command every 12th minute on the hour:

12 * * * *
You can also use different options for each placeholder. To run a command every 15 minutes:

0,15,30,45 * * * *
To run a command every day at 4:00am, you’d use:

0 4 * * *
To run a command every Tuesday at 4:00am, you’d use:

0 4 * * 2
You can use division in your schedule. Instead of listing out 0,15,30,45, you could also use the following:

*/4 2-6 * * *
Notice the “2-6” range. This syntax will run the command between the hours of 2:00am and 6:00am.
