There can be multiple things preventing the rewrite rule from working. My ubuntu server needed 3 things changed to get permalinks working.

In newer versions of apache2, you need to enable the module:

sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo service apache2 restart
You may also need to modify the apache2.conf file.

sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
Change your web directory override rule to AllowOverride All.

<Directory /var/www/>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>
After that, restart the service again.

The .htaccess file in the WordPress install directory needs to be owned or readable/modifiable by the webserver.

This can be accomplished by changing owner to www-data (usually the webserver user), or changing permissions.

sudo chown www-data /var/www/wordpress-install/.htaccess 
OR

sudo chmod 664 /var/www/wordpress-install/.htaccess
Login to your Wordpress admin backend and save the permalink settings, and they should hopefully be working.
