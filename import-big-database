Solution for LINUX USERS (run with sudo)

Create 'upload' and 'save' directories:

mkdir /etc/phpmyadmin/upload
mkdir /etc/phpmyadmin/save
chmod a+w /etc/phpmyadmin/upload
chmod a+w /etc/phpmyadmin/save
Then edit phpmyadmin's config file:

gedit /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php
Finally add absolute path for both 'upload' and 'save' directories:

$cfg['UploadDir'] = '/etc/phpmyadmin/upload';
$cfg['SaveDir'] = '/etc/phpmyadmin/save';
Now, just drop files on /etc/phpmyadmin/upload folder and then you'll be able to select them from phpmyadmin.
